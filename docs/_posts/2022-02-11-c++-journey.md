### I been reading Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ and I suck

After my first post, the next day i got my order book Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++. What i think when i got that was, "I will reading this book every day while learning unreal engine at the same time".
Well as usual that fucking lie, I think i can commit my self to write blog post every day for the rest of the year 2022, that lie too. I hate why i always doing the same mistake time i tried to commit on somethings.
well enough of whining, I read the book, i learn few things that i need at least to be able read c++ code.

I have finish the first vol of the books, now i will focusing on making the game, i'm planning on making car game that the theme. So here the Idea i todo things i need todo this week:

- Collision detection
- Car acceleration, break

Well thats all i want to share, will try my best to give more information tomorrow i need some rest and depress again because i waste my times.
