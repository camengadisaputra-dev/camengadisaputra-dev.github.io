### Yay finally i manage to create blog post! :tada:

This afternoon i decided spend rest of my day to start creating blog. At first i was going to use heroku, nodejs, and reactjs. That overkill for simple blog!,
Then i found out about gatsby in my head i think gatsby should do the job. After one hour searching for tutorial, step by step on integrating to github, I don't know but i don't like the way they keep suggesting me to use their cloud service And then i give up on using that.

Finally i found this amazing html generator, At first i want to use some theme so i can just focus on writing my blog. I didn't find any theme that match my taste. Then i decided to create my own i this is the theme that i came out with
